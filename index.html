          The idea will be that:
          <ul>
            <li> You'll go to a page with an exercise on it </li>
            <li> You'll set up your own html page locally </li>
            <li> You'll include a link to the javascript </li>
            <li> You'll make your html look / function like it does in the exercise </li>
            <li> Open your console. The included javascript will test your DOM to see if that matches what's expected </li>
            <li> The exercises will be built to expect flexiblity of DOM structure </li>
          </ul>
