Quick list:

* Project structure:
  * tests should have a /resources folder, containing html files
  * tests should use jsdom to load those files
  * src/general should have files full of functions that run MAF and mocha tests
  * src/general files should allow for dependancy injection of the window object
  * We should have one test file per final exercise. 

* Each exercise section:
  * Has an HTML page, explaining the exercises
  * Has a javascript link that can be included into the page
  * Has a topic to cover ( best practises, setup, meta )
